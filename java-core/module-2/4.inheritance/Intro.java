// one super class is having more than one subclass at same level is known as herarical in haritrance
// one subclass is having more than one super class at same level is known as multiple inharitance, in java we can not achive multiple inharitanc ewith the help of class because of dimond problem, to achive multiple inheritance in java we have to use interface.
// combination of any two or more inharitance is called hybrid inharitance
