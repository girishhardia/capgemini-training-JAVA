// A product team is prototyping a lightweight text editor to demonstrate Strings (immutable) 
// and StringBuilder (mutable) alongside core OOP principles. The editor must 
// support: typing, deleting, replacing, searching, extracting substrings, and 
// validating text, using a clean separation of concerns.
