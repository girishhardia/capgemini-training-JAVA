// Polymorphism: An ability of an object to exhibit more than one form is known as polymorphism.
                // one name but different forms

// Types of Polymorphism
// 1. Compile time polymorphism
//      The binding happens during compile time is known as compile time polymorphism.
//      It is also known as static binding or early binding.
//      We can achieve compile time polymorphism using
//      1. Method overloading
//      2. Constructor overloading
//      3. Variable shadowing
//      4. Method shadowing
//      
// 2. Run time polymorphism
//      The binding happens during runtime is known as run time polymorphism.
//      It is also known as dynamic binding or late binding.
//      We can achieve run time polymorphism using
//      1. Method overriding
